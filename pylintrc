# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s).
# redefined because pylint isn't able to handle relative imports
# the following are disabled for pedagogical reasons:
# C0206: use `for k, v in d.items()` instead of `for k in d: for v in d[k]:`
# C1803: use `not X` instead of `X == []`
# R0801: duplicate code in different files
# R1735: use `{}` instead of `dict()`
