    # Representation
    # --------------
    # The queue is represented as a linked list of nodes.
    # Each node has one item and points to the next node.
    # The next node of the last node is `None`.
    # A node is represented by a Python list of size 2:
    # position 0 has the item, position 1 has the next node.
    # Hence the constants above.
    #
    # The queue is a pair of pointers, to the first and last nodes.
    # This allows direct access to the front and back of the queue,
    # to quickly add and remove items.
    # If the queue is empty, the first and last nodes are `None`.
