"""Implementations of some algorithms related to sorting.

Each algorithm assumes a list of comparable items.
Functions ending in `_sort` change the list in place.
Functions ending in `_sorted` don't change the unsorted list,
and return a new sorted list.
This matches the Python built-in functions:
`items.sort()` sorts the list in-place, `sorted(items)` returns a new list.

# ---------
# - Why must a list of length 1 also be a base case for merge sort?
# - In quicksort, could the items equal to the pivot be added
#   to the right instead of the left partition?
# - What needs to change in each function to sort in descending order?
# - Why doesn't the quickselect algorithm check for the typical base cases
#   (list with 0 or 1 item)?
