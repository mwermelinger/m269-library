    # Representation
    # --------------
    # The priority queue is implemented as a min binary heap,
    # which is a complete binary tree where:
    # each node is a key-value pair;
    # keys are comparable but don't have to be unique;
    # each node's key is smaller than or equal to its children's keys.
    # The heap is represented as a list starting at position 1.
    # Because the tree is binary and complete, if a node is at position n
    # then its children (if they exist), must be at positions 2n and 2n+1.
    # Conversely, if a node is at position n, its parent is at n // 2.
    #
    # Each heap node is a list of length 2 (key and value).
    #
    # For a priority queue the key is the priority and the value is the item.
    # The method signatures and docstrings refer to
    # the public view (a queue with items and priorities),
    # but the code and comments refer to
    # the internal view (a heap with key-value nodes).
