    """Implement a directed graph (digraph).

    Each node must be a hashable value:
    a number, string, tuple of hashable values, etc.
    Each edge has a direction, i.e. it goes **from** a node **to** another.
    The two nodes must be different.
    Each edge has a weight, which must be a positive number.
    If all weights are the same, the graph is effectively unweighted.
    """

    # Representation
    # --------------
    # The digraph is stored as two dictionaries-of-dictionaries.
    # In the `_nodes` dictionary, keys are nodes, and values are
    # dictionaries where the algorithms store information about the nodes,
    # e.g. which nodes have been visited.
    # In the `_edges` dictionary, keys are nodes, and values are
    # dictionaries where the keys are nodes and the values are weights.
    #
    # For example, a digraph with two nodes `'start'` and `'end'` and
    # a single edge between them of weight 3 is represented as
    # `_nodes = {'start': {}, 'end': {}}`
    # and
    # `_edges = {'start': {'end': 3}}`.
    # After running an algorithm to visit the nodes, `_nodes` may be
    # `{'start': {'seen': True}, 'end': {'seen': True}}`.

# Exercises
# ---------
# - Add a method to:
#   - compute the **size** of a graph, i.e. the number of edges.
#   - compute the **order** of a graph, i.e. the number of nodes.
#   - check if a given list of nodes is a path in the graph.
#   - check if a graph is unweighted.
# - Every call to `shortest_path` and `weighted_distance` runs Dijkstra's
#   algorithm. Change the code of several methods, so that a sequence of
#   method calls like for example
#   ```
#   print(graph.shortest_path(2, 5))
#   print(graph.visited_bfs())
#   print(graph.shortest_path(2, 3))
#   print(graph.unweighted_distance(3, 5))
#   print(graph.weighted_distance(2, 1))
#   ```
#   will execute Dijkstra's method only once.
